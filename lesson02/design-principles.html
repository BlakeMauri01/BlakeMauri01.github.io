        <h1>Hick's Law</h1>
        <h2>Hulu</h2>
        
        <h2><img src="images/hulu.png" alt="Hick's Law example screenshot"></h2>
        <a href= "https://www.hulu.com/">Link to Hulu</a>
        <p>Hick's Law essentially states that the greater the number of options, the longer it takes a subject to react or make a decision.
            By creating a minimal but powerful set of options, a subject is able to make an easy yet effective choice.
            The more options listed the more difficult a webpage becomes to navigate.</p>
        <p>Note in the provided example on Hulu that many options are isted for genres, however they are compartmentaized into columns and rows. 
            This assists in the decision making choice by not having a cultted user interface.</p>

        <a href= "https://tympanus.net/codrops/">Link to Codrops</a>
        <p>The Rule of Thirds is a technique used to create a visually appealing subject by dividing said subject using 2 horizontal and two vertical lines.
            The example displayed contains this grid pattern. The eye is naturally drawn from section to section in a natural flowing pattern.</p>

        <h2>Spotify</h2>
        <h2><img src="images/spotify.png" alt="Visual Hierarchy example screenshot"></h2>
        <a href= "https://www.spotify.com/us/">Link to Spotify</a>
        <p>Visual Hirarchy is a design tehnique that utilizes arrangement of elemnets on a page to imply importance.
            The eye is drawn to larger portions of a given webpage element to signifiy that importance.
            The example provided is the music player on the spotify webpage. The list of songs in the album take up the majority of space, followed by the album artwork.</p>
        <p>On the left of the page the menu for navigation is listed and provides easy access to saved playlists and saved albums in the libary.
            Finally the play/pause button is highlighted in a green that catches the eye and has whitespace surrounding it to isolate it for easy use.</p>
